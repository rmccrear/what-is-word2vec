## AI Assistance

This project was developed with the assistance of **Composer** (a language model trained by Cursor), an AI coding assistant. AI was used for:

- **Code generation and refactoring**: AI was used to help write, refactor, and optimize code throughout the project
- **Testing**: AI assistance was used to create and maintain test suites
- **Documentation**: AI tools helped generate and improve documentation
- **Code review**: AI was used to review code for best practices and potential improvements
